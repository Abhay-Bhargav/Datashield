                          Project Name: DataShield360 – AI Agents for Ethical Big Data

In today’s digital era, over 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are generated every single day, ranging from social media interactions to healthcare and financial records. While this presents massive opportunities for innovation and monetization, it also introduces unprecedented risks to privacy, security, and ethical usage. High-profile incidents like Cambridge Analytica highlighted how vulnerable our personal data can be when exploited at scale. This inspired us to create DataShield360—an AI-driven system designed to safeguard data integrity while enabling responsible and compliant Big Data usage.

What Inspired Us:
       India, with its billion-plus population, is becoming a global leader in data generation through platforms like Aadhaar, UPI, and digital healthcare systems. However, privacy breaches and unauthorized use of sensitive data continue to erode trust. We envisioned DataShield360 as a guardian—AI agents that autonomously monitor data pipelines, detect anomalies, and ensure compliance with global and local privacy regulations such as GDPR and India’s DPDP Act.

What We Learned:
We learned how Generative AI models like IBM’s Granite series can interpret complex legal frameworks, while IBM’s Agent Development Kit (ADK) allows the creation of self-governing AI agents capable of real-time compliance monitoring. Balancing automation with transparency emerged as a critical insight—users and organizations need clear, interpretable AI decisions.

How We Built It:
Granite AI Models to process and interpret privacy rules and ethical guidelines.
ADK-powered Agents to detect and prevent misuse, generate compliance reports, and flag anomalies in Big Data streams.
Interactive Dashboard for visualizing compliance status, data flows, and risk alerts.

Challenges We Faced:
Handling petabyte-scale data with minimal latency while ensuring strong security.
Designing explainable AI that communicates decisions in clear, non-technical language.
Building a scalable framework applicable across industries while starting with high-risk sectors like healthcare and fintech.

DataShield360 is not just a tool—it is a blueprint for a future where AI actively protects data, ensuring ethical usage, legal compliance, and digital trust
